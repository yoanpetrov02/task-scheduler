# task-scheduler
Multi-threaded task scheduler implementation in Java.

# Setup
Run the main class. You can pass a number in the command-line arguments, which will specify the number of threads in the thread pool.\
You can experiment with the task scheduler in a console 'client' implementation, which will prompt you to enter a task type and a command until you tell it 'STOP!' (which will tell it to stop, obviously).
